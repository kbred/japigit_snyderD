API & JSON Deliverable
Now that we have all the pieces, you need to build a Python program, called japi.py to get the price of a stock using an API. Complete the tasks below:

1)	Write a function called getStockData() that takes a stock’s symbol as parameter and return the JSON-formatted response-string

2)	Write the main function that :
    	infinitely asks the user for a stock symbol until the user enters quit. 
    	Pass that symbol to the getStockData function. 
    	Print the JSON-formatted response on the screen
    	Convert the response from JSON to Python dictionary
    	Print the price ONLY in the form: 

The current price of <stock symbol> is: <Stock Price>

3)	Make a call to the main() function

4)	Run the program with at least 5 symbols and save the output into the file japi.out
